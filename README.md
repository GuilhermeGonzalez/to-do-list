## Proposed Activities
- [x] Add a new task
- [x] Remove a task
- [x] Mark and unmark a task as completed



<h3>Add a new task</h3>
<p align="left">For this solution, it was checked if the input field contained any information before insertion. After this verification, a random number is generated for the ID, and the element is inserted at the end of the tasks array.</p>

<h3>Remove a task</h3>
<p align="left">In this solution, a filter was basically applied to ignore the element of the array containing the desired id to be excluded, thus applying setTasks with the result of the filter method.</p>

<h3>Mark and unmark a task as completed</h3>
<p align="left">In this solution, a ternary if statement was applied just to invert the boolean value of the task's isComplete, after locating it with a map function.</p>
